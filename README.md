Installation

2. Fork this repository to your machine
3. `cd` to the forked directory and run `jekyll serve --watch`
4. Celebrate and dance.

Contributions
===

In general, there are no strict rules for contributing, only that your code is clean and well structured.

For bugs:
- To merge a fix, you can simply open a pull request.
- To report one that is not yet fixed, open an issue.

Feature requests:
- **Always** open an issue first before implementing and proposing a new feature. This is only so I can make sure the theme doesn't become bloated with too many features. This way, I can determine if an idea is something that makes sense for the theme's design.

If in doubt, you can always ask me on Twitter: [@jeffxmn](https://twitter.com/jeffxmn)
